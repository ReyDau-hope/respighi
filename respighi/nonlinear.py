    Parameters
    ----------
    relaxation
        Damping strategy. Its estimation block is primary-sized, so an
        :class:`AitkenRelaxation` should be constructed with the primary
        length, not the state length. Defaults to undamped.
    maxiter
        Iteration budget. Exhausting it warns and returns a non-converged result.
    xclose
        Tolerance on the infinity norm of the raw update, in primary space.
    rclose
        Tolerance on the residual, scaled per entry by the system diagonal so
        the criterion is dimensionally consistent across cells with very
        different conductances. Distinct from ``xclose``: the two have
        different units and there is no reason for them to share a value.

    Each iteration evaluates the residual at the current state, tests for
    convergence, then solves the linearised system and applies a relaxed
    update. Testing before the first solve means an already-converged state
    costs zero linear solves.

    Convergence requires both the infinity norm of the raw update to fall below
    ``xclose`` and every scaled residual to fall below one. The update is
    measured undamped: with a small relaxation factor the applied step can be
    small while the underlying Newton step is not, so testing the damped step
    reports convergence that has not happened.
